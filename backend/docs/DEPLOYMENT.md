# üöÄ Secure Deployment Guide - Task Manager

## Overview
This guide walks you through securely deploying the Task Manager application across different environments with comprehensive security measures.

## üèóÔ∏è Quick Setup

### 1. Generate Environment Configuration
```bash
# For development
npm run setup:dev

# For staging
npm run setup:staging

# For production
npm run setup:prod
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
After running the setup script, update the generated `.env` file:

```bash
# Update database connection
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

# Update domain (staging/production)
FRONTEND_URL=https://yourdomain.com

# Configure email service (optional)
EMAIL_SERVICE=sendgrid
EMAIL_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
```

### 3. Run Security Tests
```bash
# Import Postman collection and run security tests
npm run test:security

# Run dependency security audit
npm run audit:security
```

## üåç Environment-Specific Deployment

### Development Environment

#### Setup
```bash
# 1. Generate development configuration
npm run setup:dev

# 2. Update database URL in .env

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Testing Workflow

### 1. Automated Testing
```bash
# Run security audit
npm run audit:security

# Import and run Postman collection
# File: docs/security-test-collection.json
# Tests: Authentication, Authorization, Input Validation, Rate Limiting
```

### 2. Manual Security Checks

#### Authentication Testing
- [ ] Valid login works
- [ ] Invalid credentials rejected
- [ ] Token validation working
- [ ] Token expiration handled
- [ ] Password requirements enforced

#### Authorization Testing
- [ ] Users can only access own resources
- [ ] Cross-user access blocked
- [ ] Bulk operations verified
- [ ] Admin privileges (if applicable)

#### Input Validation Testing
- [ ] SQL injection attempts blocked
- [ ] XSS attempts sanitized
- [ ] Invalid ObjectIds rejected
- [ ] Oversized requests handled
- [ ] Special characters handled

#### Infrastructure Testing
- [ ] HTTPS redirection working
- [ ] Security headers present
- [ ] CORS properly configured
- [ ] Rate limiting active
- [ ] Error messages sanitized

### 3. Performance Testing
```bash
# Load testing with rate limits
# Use tools like Artillery, k6, or Apache Bench
ab -n 1000 -c 10 https://yourdomain.com/api/health

# Monitor response times and error rates
# Verify rate limiting kicks in appropriately
```

## üö® Security Incident Response

### 1. Detection
- Monitor security event logs
- Set up alerts for suspicious activity
- Review error reports regularly
- Monitor performance anomalies

### 2. Response Procedures
```bash
# Immediate response to security incident:

# 1. Assess the threat
tail -f /var/log/security.log

# 2. Block malicious IPs (if applicable)
sudo ufw deny from MALICIOUS_IP

# 3. Rotate secrets if compromised
npm run setup:prod  # Generate new secrets
# Update environment variables
# Restart services

# 4. Review and patch vulnerabilities
npm audit fix
npm update

# 5. Document incident and lessons learned
```

### 3. Recovery

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### CORS Errors
```bash
# Check allowed origins in environment
echo $CORS_ORIGIN

# Verify frontend URL matches
echo $FRONTEND_URL

# Test with curl
curl -H "Origin: https://yourdomain.com" -v https://api.yourdomain.com/api/health
```

#### JWT Token Issues
```bash
# Verify JWT secret is set
echo $JWT_SECRET | wc -c  # Should be 128+ characters

# Check token expiration
# Use jwt.io to decode and inspect tokens

# Verify user exists in database
```

#### Rate Limiting Issues
```bash
# Check if rate limiting is enabled
echo $RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS

# Monitor rate limit headers in responses
curl -v https://yourdomain.com/api/tasks

# Adjust limits if needed for legitimate traffic
```

#### SSL/HTTPS Issues
```bash
# Check certificate validity
openssl x509 -in /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/cert.pem -text -noout

# Test SSL configuration
curl -I https://yourdomain.com

# Renew certificate if needed
sudo certbot renew
```

### Getting Help
- Review security documentation: `/docs/SECURITY.md`
